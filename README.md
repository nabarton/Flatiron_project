# UFO Sightings

This project aims to find some patterns in global UFO sightings over the past century, 
taking the kaggle UFO data set found in the following repository: 

"https://www.kaggle.com/hakeemtfrank/ufo-sightings-data-exploration"

The dataset has been randomly halved before being imported into jupyter notebook, since
I have not got the time to sort all of the many issues found in the original dataset.
